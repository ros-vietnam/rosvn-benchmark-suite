# ROS Vietnam – Robotics Benchmark Suite  
`rosvn-benchmark-suite`

> **A standardized, reproducible, and academically rigorous benchmarking framework for robotics algorithms in ROS 2.**

---

## 1. Overview

**ROS Vietnam Robotics Benchmark Suite** is the official benchmarking repository of the **ROS Vietnam** community.

This repository provides a **neutral, transparent, and reproducible framework** to evaluate robotics algorithms across:
- Simulation
- Metrics
- Experimental protocols

It is designed to ensure **fair comparison**, **scientific integrity**, and **long-term reproducibility**.

> This repository does not promote algorithms.  
> It evaluates them.

## 2. Why Benchmarking Matters

Without standardized benchmarks:
- Results are not comparable
- Claims are not verifiable
- Progress is unclear
- Research becomes anecdotal

This repository exists to:
- Separate performance from marketing
- Encourage honest evaluation
- Enable reproducible robotics research
- Establish community-wide standards

> *Benchmarks are the backbone of scientific progress.*

## 3. Philosophy

### 3.1 Neutrality
- Algorithm-agnostic
- Vendor-neutral
- No preferred approach

### 3.2 Reproducibility
- Fixed environments
- Controlled randomness
- Versioned datasets

### 3.3 Transparency
- All metrics documented
- All assumptions explicit
- All results explainable

### 3.4 Scientific Rigor
- Statistical validity
- Multiple trials
- Confidence reporting
